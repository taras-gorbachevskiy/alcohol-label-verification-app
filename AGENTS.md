You are helping build the TTB Label Verification proof-of-concept. Standing rules for the whole
project: 1. Stack: Python 3.12 + FastAPI backend, React (or plain HTML/JS) frontend, a vision
model for extraction, no database (stateless / in-memory). Deploy target: a free-tier host (e.g.
Railway, or Vercel + Render). 2. Hard requirements that override convenience: single-label result
in UNDER 5 SECONDS; UI usable by a non-technical 70+ user with no instructions; BATCH UPLOAD is
required, not optional; the government warning is an EXACT, case-sensitive match while all other
fields are fuzzy/normalized; API keys live in ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ONLY — never hardcoded, never
committed. 3. Working cadence: when I say PLAN, propose an approach and list files/risks but
write NO code. When I say REVIEW, critique that plan against the requirements and edge cases and
finalize it. When I say EXECUTE, implement exactly the approved plan with tests, then tell me how
to verify it. Keep scope to the current phase only. 4. Prefer correctness and clean structure
over ambition. Confirm you understand these rules.
